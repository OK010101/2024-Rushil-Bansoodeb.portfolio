        <h2>About Me.</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Rushil Bansoodeb, and I was born on this beautiful small island called Mauritius. I studied there until the end of my high school. After high school, I just didn't know where to go in the future. Slowly, I realized that I was creative, so I decided to make a living off all these hobbies. I chose to go abroad for my further studies, and that is how I end up opting for a choice that would become the way for the future: graphic design. I decided to join Humber College for the purpose of gaining skills and experience in this particular field, and I'm now doing an advanced diploma in graphic design.</p>

        <h2>What Did I Learn.</h2>
        <p>I learned much from my teachers, who were so willing to share the insights that came with being a graphic designer. In my three years at Humber College, I developed experience and expertise in using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and others. I am also able to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also did an internship at Paywise Ltd. for six months, where I produced a number of videos for the company's website and social media. I further developed leadership and communication skills during my time at this company. I believe that with all of these experiences and skills, I am ready to work in this field. However, I still want to gain experience and learn from others.</p>
